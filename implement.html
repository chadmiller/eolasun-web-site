<h1>Implement it!</h1>

<h2>Owned by schools</h2>

<p>
The model will span almost the breadth of central Florida, as several
discrete pieces that share a theme and a common sign.
</p>

<p>
Each piece of the model will be a planet and probably its moons, and each
planet site will be stewarded by a school. 
<a href="http//www.cpalms.org/Public/search/Search?keywords=%2522solar%2520system%2522">Judging from Florida&rsquo;s required
topic schedule,</a> the &ldquo;owner&rdquo; of each site will probably be a school&rsquo;s 8th-grade
science classes.
</p>

<h2>Part of the whole, accurately placed</h2>

<p>
At each site, there will be a standard piece, a durable sign that tells the
general story of the model and sets the context for the parts around it. The
sign placed next to a model piece will be about 2ft by 2ft, and have no
information specific to a site&rsquo;s planet.
</p>

<p>
Each model planet must be shown in its orbital path (or a trivial distance
outside of it, if the benefit of a location is too good to pass up). The size 
of the planet and moons must be to scale, with no more than 5% error in any
dimension. We care about size and distance accuracy in this model.
</p>

<h2>Composition and longevity</h2>

<p>
Each site of the project will be given either a fraction of the funds (to be
used only for materials or tools). The specifics of how to construct a site are
up to the local authority for it, but Chad will try to facilitate efficiently
shared resources for construction. Whatever the medium, you must aim for a
longevity of at least 10 years.
</p>

<p>
We don&rsquo;t yet know what kind of funding will be available. Some ideas are simple
painting on cement, mechanical etching on cement, acid etching on cement,
ceramic embossing on cement, drawing in wet cement, sculpture. The costs of
those vary, so it&rsquo;s hard to predict up front, before funding arrives, which to
choose. A site can, of course, add its own funding to make something grander.
</p>

<h2>Contents and standards</h2>

<p>
There are a few ideas a site has to present. The accompanying given sign will
have the name of the model, a short description, and a reference to the web
site to hold more information and context of what, where, why, and who. A
visitor must not need access to the Internet to understand your piece of the
model, though the web site can have supplementary information specific to a
site.
</p>

<p>
A site must have the name of the planet, and illustrate the relative size of
the planet unambiguously. It should say the duration of orbit, in terms of
Earth years or days (Earth, excepted). It should also show the path through
space the planet sweeps, from the North down. That means the planets will
travel counterclockwise around the Sun.
</p>

<p>
If it makes the model clear, the site should also include the actual distance
to the Sun and the actual speed around the Sun.  Avoid mixing model numbers and
actual numbers by using comparisons to describe model speed. Model distance
should be obvious to a city traveler and so shouldn&rsquo;t be mentioned.
</p>

<p>
All units must be metric, though secondary notation in ancient Imperial runes
are acceptable.

This is just a bunch of notes for now. Lots of work to be done here.
