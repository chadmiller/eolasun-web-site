<h1>FAQ</h1>

<p>
<q>Why not center on the big ball in Epcot?</q>
We could have centered on Spaceship Earth. It&rsquo;s a really nice sphere. However, it&rsquo;s not easy to get to, and it&rsquo;s not free. Additionally, <a href="http//thinkzone.wlonk.com/SS/SolarSystemMap.html?obj=Sun&amp;dia=165ft&amp;loc=28.375321,-81.549408">the orbits are not very pleasing.</a> Uranus goes through Tampa, which is nice, but the inner rocky planets are in the middle of nowhere.
</p>

<p>
<q>Why did you leave out Pluto?</q>
Pluto is weird. It&rsquo;s small, and far away and starts a cloud of bazillions of similar objects. Astronomers have to draw the line somewhere. For our case, it has two problems: Its path is really un-circular, and its orbital plane is far different than other things we model. What we place could be closer to the Sun than Neptune, and hundreds of feet in the air above the ground, and still be &ldquo;accurate.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
<q>How accurate is the model, really?</q>
It&rsquo;s really close to reality in terms of relative distances to the Sun, but there is no fidelity to any point in time and its relative position of planets.

<p>
<q>How big is this, compared to other models?</q>
<a href="http//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_System_model#Scale_models_in_various_locations">According to Wikipedia,</a> this would be the fourth largest in the world. Biggest will be Spaced Out in the UK at 1:15MM, then Sweden at 1:20MM, then SSDrive at 1:38MM. Ours is 1:44MM. Ours is the biggest in the United States.
